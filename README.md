# spin4d-data
SPIN4D data exploration

This data set comprises various simulations of the solar photosphere with varying initial conditions.
The MURaM simulation was used to produce spatial snapshots in time of spatial volumes for 12 state variables.
A modified SIR Stokes inversion and line synthesis program was used to produce Stokes profiles for selected cube snapshots.

## Synthesized Stokes Profiles
The SIR directory contains synthesized Stokes profiles for selected cube snapshots.

## MURaM Cubes
The SPIN4D_SSD* directories contain the MURaM cube snapshots for various simulation runs with differing initial conditions.
